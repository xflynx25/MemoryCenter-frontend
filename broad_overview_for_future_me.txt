issue tracking in issues.txt rn 

weird problems with dart:io platform only can be used in ios, so need to make sure never called for web 

flutter uses this widget setup thing, pretty intuitive nested building of stuff 
need to watch out for dev for computer and then overflowing on phone 

also some heinous problems with my bad implementation of the navbar 
firebase also will be annoying if we ever have to use it, because of the weird import errors that matt nay was having as well 

of course when you ask permissions in ios, remember we are going to need to change the plist or something to give the reason (think 6.5660)

but the readme should be pretty good
