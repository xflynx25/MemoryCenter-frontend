1. (SOLVED) trailing delimiters produce an extra blank card
2. (SOLVED) heroku seems to be going down on big inputs, only 30 chars or less for front / back 
3. we fetch everything when we hit the profile, would be better to just load the items when they try to extend
4. (SOLVED) people can send unlimited stuff, we should be limiting them
5. (SOLVED) the last item problem, what we could do is to not take the first N items, when we are fetching with N left, therefore we won't repeat. 
5.5 (SOLVED) additionally, doesn't seem like we randomize the order once we pull in, which results in this determinism which is unpleasant. 
6. (SOLVED -- but will make it harder to modularize the fetching of items) would be nice to have some sort of a marker on the collection of your vocab size or how well you are doing
    6.1 (SOLVED) also to rank them on the dropdown, in order of the score
        6.1.a (SOLVED) and to allow to reverse
7. need to be able to change the name of topics and collecitons (maybe the cascade saves us here)
8. (SOLVED) when you go out of studying, need to return to the main page to get the updated scores. should automatically refresh
9. when you submit but with some malformatted ones in item submission style 0, you will get weird artifact until you go out and come back in
10. the ui is so busy. When you have many items topics and coollections, just having one column is a lot. Possibly, we can have two columns, one to show the collections and topics, and then you can click to focus on one, and that goes in the focus region in the other colummn. 
11. some absurdly long files (profile page), these could be moved into folder and have the subcomponents contracted out to different files
12. we have paved the way for eventually preventing you to load all items on page start. Right now still have to because we need the topic names to edit collections, but if we had two calls, one for topic names, and another for the items, we can seperate this.
