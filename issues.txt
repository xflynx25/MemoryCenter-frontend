1. trailing delimiters produce an extra blank card
    .. let me solve this on the backend

    SOLVED
3. we fetch everything when we hit the profile, would be better to just load the items when they try to extend
4. people can send unlimited stuff, we should be limiting them
5. the last item problem, what we could do is to not take the first N items, when we are fetching with N left, therefore we won't repeat. 
5.5 additionally, doesn't seem like we randomize the order once we pull in, which results in this determinism which is unpleasant.
