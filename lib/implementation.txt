register button takes to different page
register and login display loading button when clicked
if register, takes back to login page
if login, will take you to home page, by sending request to /home with token 

no refresh token implemented
garbage UI
register / login seperateness & non-auto-login with register is clunky 

issue: used_id is not getting sent on the get_all_collections and topics, and somehow always returning zetas, and they should be private
    so in other words, I think what is likely happening is that zeta cookie somehow always being sent, even when we log in other.
