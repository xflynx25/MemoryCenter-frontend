register button takes to different page
register and login display loading button when clicked
if register, takes back to login page
if login, will take you to home page, by sending request to /home with token 

no refresh token implemented
garbage UI
register / login seperateness & non-auto-login with register is clunky 

long term might want to do search on the server side

for the home page auto refresh couldn't get it to work when you go from the search
